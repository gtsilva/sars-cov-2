## Understanding SARS-CoV-2

### Questions:
- What are the exact roles of ORF1a and ORF1b?
- Is TM score (as defined by the Zhang lab https://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/TM-score/ ) a good tool for estimating protein similarity (e.g. between Sars1, or MERS and Sars-cov-2)
- Is ORF3a (encoding the viroporin) behind the disease phenotype?
	- What is this channel pearmeable for?
	- What are the basic electrophysiological properties of this viroporin?
		- Any antagonists perhaps modulators?
	- What class of viroporin is encoded here (following the classification scheme proposed by Nieva et al 2012)?	
	- what gates the channel?
- Is protein E (26245:26472) behind the viroporin (as suggested by Nieva et al 2012), namely:
	- "(SARS-CoV). These viruses encode a small protein named envelope small membrane protein (E protein), which ranges from 76 to 109 amino acids in size44. It consists of a short hydrophilic domain (about 21–29 residues) preceding the transmembrane region, which is followed by a longer hydrophilic carboxyl tail. The amino-terminal 40 amino acids of SARS-CoV E protein are sufficient for the formation of ion channels that are selective for monovalent cations"
- How perfect (or far from perfect) is the RCB(receptor binding pocket) affinity to human ACE2?
	- how can one compare binding affinities between SARS-CoV-2 RCB and human ACE2 or bat ACE2 (or any other species)?
		- if through simulation, what kind?
- (RCB related): Is there an example of fully formed polybasic cleavage sites in any SARS-CoV-2-like virus from animals in the literature? Can a BLAST search help here?

When these proteins oligomerize in host cell membranes, they form hydrophilic pores that disrupt a number of physiological properties of the cell. Viroporins are crucial for viral pathogenicity"
